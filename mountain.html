    <h1>MOUNTAIN</h1>

    <br>
<p>
  When people think of mountain biking, they may think it literally means to ride down a mountain side. Thatâ€™s not necessarily true. While that is an option, there is such a wide variety of options when it comes to riding a mountain bike. Not only are there many options for terrain choices, but there are various styles of mountain bikes themselves to choose from.
</p>

<br>

<p>
  The main two options to choose from in a mountain bike are the frames. You can get either a hardtail or a full-suspension bike. Older style mountain bikes used rigid forks, which meant you have no suspension at all. This made for a rough ride compared to the current bike selection.

<p>
  Hardtail bikes are generally preferred for lighter trails, cross country, pump tracks, and other terrain where it may not be very rough. This is due to the fact that hardtail frames are a typically a little bit lighter than full suspension frames. Also, pedaling efficiency is greater in hardtails since your wont lose any power generated pedaling to the rear shock.

<p>
  Full Suspension bikes are ideal for rough terrain, downhill, jump tracks, and enduro style riding. Not only does the full suspension frame have the front shock like the hardtail bikes, it also has a shock and pivot points towards the back of the bike. This allows the bike to absorb more of the shock, which reduces stresses and damage to the bike itself, as well as the rider. Full suspension bikes are generally slightly heavier than hardtail bikes, as well as more expensive.
