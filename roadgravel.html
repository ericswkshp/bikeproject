    <h1>ROAD/GRAVEL</h1>

    <br>
<p>
  If you don’t like the idea of griding uphill trails and descending narrow  rocky paths, maybe consider trying a road or gravel bike. Road bikes and gravel bikes are very similar in geometry, feel, and ride style. When I am short on time, but still want to get some miles in, I will get on my gravel bike and pedal to wherever I can get to and back within the time I have available. While I prefer to ride trails, I enjoy riding road style bikes as they allow you to cover a greater distance with less effort.

  Road bikes are typically a few ounces or even pounds lighter than gravel bikes. They have a bike more aggressive posture, which the rider’s torso is a little closer to parallel with the ground. Aerodynamics is a big part of cycling, which is also why you may see cyclists wearing tight-fitting gear and funny looking helmets.

  Much like road bikes, gravel bikes often have a more aggressive posture than mountain bikes, as well as handlebar “drops”. Drops are the part of the handlebar that curl down to allow the rider to get into an even more aggressive position. Gravel bikes, however, tend to be built in a way that allows a wider tire to be used. This allows the bike to travel over a greater variety of terrain. This ability to go off the road does hinder the overall speed on the road when compared to a thinner road style tire.
