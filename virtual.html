    <h1>VIRTUAL</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      Virtual cycling is something I NEVER could have imagined I would get into. Cycling in general was never even on my radar, let alone a stationary bike. Something happened the more I got into riding, and before I knew it I was riding with people all over the world via Zwift. There are several apps or programs that allow you to ride virtually, but I only have experience with Zwift, so I will focus on that.

    <p>
      Zwift is a program or app (depending on which platform you use) that allows the user to connect a “Smart Trainer” to their computer or phone. You hook up your actual bike to this smart trainer, and as you pedal, it collects data from either a roller or flywheel that is connect to your rear axle.

    <p>
      As you watch your avatar on the screen mimic your efforts, the terrain you see on the screen will affect the resistance on your smart trainer. If you see a hill on your screen, you’re going to feel like you’re pedaling up a hill. If you see that you’re going down a hill on the screen, then there is no resistance at your feet.

    <p>
      Zwift also have many features such as group rides, races, and training programs. Zwift even has leagues and sponsorships. Each year they hold contests and select riders to receive professional contracts.

    <p>
      Obviously, riding a stationary bike that is essentially hooked up to a video game isn’t for everyone, but there are many things involved that may keep someone coming back. The app collects and saves all your data, such as mileage, calories burned, elevation gained, power output, and other stats. All of this information can be uploaded to Strava.
